    <h1>Airflow Suggestions</h1>
    <ol>General
      <li>Bigger Air space, need to let the hotter air expand and naturally draft up.
        <br> <a href="https://youtu.be/4ekOcDG2D8E?t=728">View this farm's new space</a>
        <br> In that video he talks about learning that you want to use the natural heat flow to create the negitive pressure (draft) that draws the heat up and out of the building.
      </li>
      <li>Keeping things clean.  This will be a bigger issue in the summer.  
          If you notice, even the big buildings use LOTS of empty space.  
          This empty space creates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenum_chamber">plenum chamber</a>.
          What they are doing is using the building space as intake plenum which drops out the dust particals, which they can manually sweep up and remove.

          The exhaust plenum is the rooms that are air sealed with lots of space to expand and be drawn away through air expansion.
